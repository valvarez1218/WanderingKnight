This code was written as part of a final project for a linear algebra course. 

We got the idea for this final project from the following YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63HHmjlh794&t=555s

The topic of our project deals with a knight piece on an otherwise empty chess board. The problem is as follows: Given a starting square for the knight, if you allowed it to move around at random, at each step choosing from its possible moves with equal probability, what is the average number of moves it will take for the knight to return to its starting square?

The attached pdf file explores the problem using linear algebra and Markov Chains. The code was written to simulate the problem, allowing us to ensure that the data supports the theory in the paper.
